## 🟢 NodeJS

* JS runtime environment, built on **Chrome's V8 engine** (Google Chrome's engine).
* **Event-driven architecture**
* **Async** or **non-blocking I/O**

#### Without JS engine we can't run JS code and in NodeJS at the end of the day we write JS code.

When **Ryan Dahl** developed NodeJS, he used **Spider Monkey** (Firefox's JS engine) to build it.
But **2 days into the development**, he switched to **V8**.
**Joyent Inc.** funded NodeJS initially.
Initial name of NodeJS was **web.js**.

### 💡 Why was NodeJS developed in the first place?

At that time, **Apache HTTP server** was used, which was a **Blocking Server**,
that is why **NodeJS is Non-blocking I/O**.

---

#### 🧰 NPM

A **registry** where all packages are stored for easier accessibility.

---

In **2012**, after 3 years into development, **Ryan** stepped back and **Isaac** (developer of NPM) started to manage Node.
The development slowed down.

In **2014**, an individual developer **Fedor** forked Node as **io.js**, worked on it, and it was eventually **merged in 2015**.

From here onwards, it was **not managed by Joyent Inc.** but by the **NodeJS Foundation Committee**.

In **2019**, the **OpenJS Foundation Committee**
(JS Foundation Committee + NodeJS Foundation Committee) took control over NodeJS since then.
