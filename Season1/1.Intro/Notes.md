## NodeJS
-- JS runtime environment, built on Chrome's V8 engine (Goggle Chrome's engine).
-- event driven architecture
-- async or non-blocking I/O

#### Without JS engine we can't run JS code and in NodeJS at the end of the day we write JS code.

When Ryan Dalh developed NodeJS, he used Spider Monkey (Firefox's JS engine) to built it. But 2 days into the development he switched to V8.
Joyent Inc. funded NodeJS initially. 
Initial name of NodeJS was web.js

-- Why was NodeJS developed in the first place?
At that time Apache HTTP server was used which was 'Blocking Server', that is why NodeJS is Non-blocking I/O.

#### NPM: A registry where all packages are stored for easier accessability.

In 2012, after 3 into  development Ryan stepped back and Issac(developer of NPM) started to manage Node. the development slowed down. In 2014, an individual developer Fedor forked node as io.js worked on it and it was eventually merged in 2015. From here onwards it was not managed by Joyent Inc. but by NodeJS Foundation Committee. In 2019 OpenJS Foundation Committtee (JS Foundation Committee + NodeJS Foundation Committee) took control open NodeJS since than.
